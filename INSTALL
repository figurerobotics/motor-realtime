CMake build process. For example from the root directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

It's recommended to make and install the dpkg
make package
sudo dpkg -i realtime-*.deb

Finally udev rules are helpful to connect to usb
sudo cp share/99-realtime-tmp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
